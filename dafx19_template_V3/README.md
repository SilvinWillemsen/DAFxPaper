## Additional Instructions
Note that most of the following instructions are fulfilled by using the provided templates.

1.	For **9-point type font**, there should be **no more than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically**. This is a minimum spacing; 2.75 lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make the paper much more readable. Larger type sizes require correspondingly larger vertical spacing.
2.	**Paper Title** - The paper title has to appear in **capital letters**, boldface if possible, centered across the top of the two columns on the first page as indicated above.
3.	**Authors' Name(s)** - Authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear below the title in capital and lower case letters. If space permits include a mailing address here. The templates indicate the area where the title and author information should go. These items need not be strictly confined to the number of lines indicated; papers with multiple authors and affiliations, for example, may require two or more lines for this information. However, the placement of the title should be immediately below the top line.
4.	**Abstract** - Each paper should contain an abstract that appears at the beginning of the paper.
5.	**Major Headings** - Major headings appear in capital letters, bold face, centered in the column. Examples of the various levels of headings are included in the templates.
6.	**Sub Headings** - Sub headings appear in capital and lower case, in boldface. They start at the left margin on a separate line.
7.	**Sub-Sub Headings** - Sub-sub headings appear in capital and lower case, indented like a paragraph and on a separate line. They are in italics.
8.	**References** - List and number all references at the end of the paper. The references are numbered in order of appearance in the text. When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end of this sentence [1].

9.	**Illustrations** - Illustrations must appear within the designated margins, and must be provided positioned within the paper. They may span over the two columns. When possible, place illustrations at the tops of columns, rather than in the middle or at the bottom. Caption and number every illustration. All half-tone illustrations must be clear black and white prints. Line drawings may be made in black ink on white paper. The electronic form of the proceedings will be in colour. However, consider accommodating your illustrations to black & white printing.
10.	**WWW URL links** - Authors are encouraged to include the WWW URL address in the paper and/or abstract to refer to any online information related to the paper, such as accompanied audio/video files, links of relevant publications, software and demos. The URL link allows authors to share proper and updated information with reviewers.
